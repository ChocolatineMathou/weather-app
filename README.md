# Weather App   

:construction: :construction: :construction: :construction: :construction: 

This project is part of my learning Swift process. I paired with a senior iOS engineer on the first time and then started later from scratch on my own to make sure I understood it correctly.   

Goals:   
- Build a simple interface similar to the [Weather app](https://github.com/ChocolatineMathou/weather-app/blob/master/WeatherApp/Public/Apple_Weather_app.png) on iPhone (as you can see snow is coming to London! :sunglasses:) using TableView, CollectionView and [Snapkit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit)   
- Use protocols   
- Fetch data from an API   
- Populate the app   

# Play with the project   

## Prerequisites   

You'll need [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Apple's IDE) and the dependencies manager Cocoapods. If it's not the case, just run `gem install cocoapods` in your terminal. And yes, sometimes we do use this ruby gem to manage our dependencies.   
You're good to go now! Ready?   

## Set up project

```
git clone git@github.com:ChocolatineMathou/weather-app.git
run pod install
open WeatherApp.xcworkspace
```
